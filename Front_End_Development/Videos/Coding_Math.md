# Channel: Coding Math

> This is a very important content for me, because this channel focus on the mathematics you'll need to do as programmer (*and i suck at math*). It's premise is to bring a concise and easy way to learn the basic mathematics you might need to do as a developer, so as you don't get stuck on a problem you find, besides being knowledgeable as a developer, just because of maths.
